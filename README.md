Project Description
A web-based platform that allows pet owners to book services like grooming, daycare, boarding, and veterinary appointments online. It streamlines operations for a small-scale pet care shop by managing users, doctors, bookings, and payments.

The Problem Statement
Manual pet care service bookings lead to scheduling conflicts, lack of service transparency, and poor record management. Customers face delays and shop owners struggle with tracking appointments and doctor availability.

The Solution
The system automates the entire process — from customer registration and service browsing to doctor approval and real-time email notifications. Pet owners can now book services with just a click, while shop admins efficiently manage everything through a single dashboard.
